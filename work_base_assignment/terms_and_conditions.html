           <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
           <p>
            The Headquarter's vehicle pool is intended for the general business use of all staff, and the use of any HFRS vehicle for private use/personal travel is strictly prohibited. HQ pool vehicles are not to be utilised as loan vehicles for temporary FDS duties. There are other vehicles for this purpose which are allocated to the CRS Logistics Dept.

         <h3>Booking a pool car</h3>
          <div>
              <ul>
                <li>HQ Pool vehicles will not be made available for long term loans nor block bookings</li>
                <li>All drivers must ensure that they are fully qualified to drive the category of vehicle that has been booked. This is particularly important with regard to Personnel Carrying Vehicles (PCVs) and larger vans</li>
                <li>Keys for vehicles that have been booked can only be collected from Fleet Maintenance Centre reception during normal office hours. There is no facility for key collections to be made out of hours</li>
                <li>HQ Pool vehicle Bookings will always be taken on a first come, first served basis</li>

      <h3>Using a pool car</h3>
          <div>
              <ul>
                <li>All users should remember that it is the legal responsibility of the driver to ensure the safety and roadworthiness of any vehicle that they are driving or in control of. This legal responsibility cannot be delegated to another person</li>
                <li>The vehicle maintenance checks that need to be carried out, usually weekly, are outlined inside the back cover of each vehicle log book. When these checks are carried out, this fact should be recorded in the vehicle log book. Any defects that are found during the course of these checks must be either rectified or reported (via Fire Control) to Fleet Maintenance Centre. Defect numbers must be recorded in the vehicle log book</li>
                <li>All drivers must, before using any vehicle, check to ensure that it is in a safe condition and fit for the road before driving it. This should be done even if the checks appear to have been carried out on the same or previous day</li>
                <li>Fuel for HFRS fleet pool vehicles should be obtained from HFRS station fuel pumps. Where this is genuinely not possible, the provided fuel agency card can be used. (Unnecessary use of the fuel agency cards does increase the financial burden to HFRS) Should the fuel agency card have to be used to fuel a pool vehicle, it is imperative that the receipt is sent to the Fleet Management Office at SHQ. All fuel issued to vehicles MUST have details recorded in the vehicle log book</li>
                <li>During normal office hours, keys for returned vehicles are to be taken back to Fleet Maintenance Centre reception. Out of hours, keys are to be placed in the secure “drop box” to the right of the Fleet Maintenance Centre reception entrance </li>
