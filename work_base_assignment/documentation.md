## Github Website
I have uploaded my work base assignment to my university github web page, a direct link is below.

## Background
When booking a car many people forget a few details that the fleet management team needs, and they say that they have not read the terms and conditions as they are unsure where they are kept.	
This site is designed to help the fleet management team to get people to fill in the needed information and to make the terms and conditions in the same place so everyone car read them before booking a vehicle. The site is also designed to make it easier for people to find out more about the vehicle like how many seats it has and if it has blue lights or not.

## Colours
We have corporate colour scheme at HFRS which is why I went for these colour choices

## GDPR 
The Site is intended for internal use only, therefore on the vehicle details and booking form has had the registration numbers replaced with id numbers instead. The site still works as intended but instead of selecting a registation number you will macth an ID number from the vehicle detail page.

## Further learning / Evaluation

I spoke to a few people in my team to come up with the idea of creating a booking site. Even though not everything that I would like was able to be implemented at this stage I feel this could be added later.

I did find many challenges while creating this site, mostly with the JavaScript. I tried quite a few different ways and I struggled to get it working properly so I have added some basic JavaScript to validate the booking form. 

I am still learning to try and use my time better but I still left creating the site a little late and I didn’t get time to fully implement a mobile view for the site once it gets to a certain size. I have added the nav bar to become bigger once you get down to 800px and 460px this will then move content down the page so it’s not hidden by the nav bar, however I didn't get the page to extend so some of the content goes behind the footer.
As I wanted the footer to always be at the bottom of the page using a fixed position this is what started causing issues with content being hidden.
Overall, the site works for what is needed and I would like to take this further if I had more time to research. As said above I would like to implement a backend database so you could view your bookings or see which vehicles are available in the selected dates.

This site does include the four pages. The index/Home page is mostly of to use the form. 
The detail tab I wanted to use a table to view information on vehicles HFRS has available to book. I did try a few ways, but I believe it is easier to view the information in a table view.
The booking form is a html form styled in CSS with a bit of JavaScript to validate to form. As said above I did struggle with this and it is something I will continue to learn.
The last page to view terms and conditions I decided I would like each main point to be in a separate box which makes it a little more visual where people are more likely to read. 

As said above there are a few areas that need to be fix and other areas where I like to add additional functionality which is something I will take on and learn but overall I am quite happy with the final product.
