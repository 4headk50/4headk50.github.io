# WEB TECH Practicals

## Week 1

This week I learned how to create a basic HTML 5 page along with some tags
Most tags will need a closing tag for example <h1> </h1>

```html
<h1> </h1> Header 1 - There are 6 headers you can use in HTML h1 to h6
<p> </p> Paragraph - These are used to put in text
<ul> </ul> Unordered list - grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering (Bullet Points)
<li> </li> list item - An item to be in a list
<a> </a> hyperlink - Can be used to link to other sites, email, telephone numbers ect
<br> Break - Inserts a blank row (This does not need a closing tag)
<hr> Thematic break - horizontal rule that is used to separate content (Inserts a line in the page)
<img src="" alt=""> - Inserts an image the alt is a description of the image (This will be displayed if the image 
                      cannot be loaded by the browser - it can also be used to read out what the image is)
```

## Week 2

This week I learned how use more tags and start using CSS to style a website.

```html

             Any content can be put inside a <div> tag
div#NAME|c - This creates a div tag with an id of what ever the name is and with creates a closing comment with the name 
             i.e div#content|c will create a Div with an id of content and a closing comment of content (The |c creates the closing comment)
```
